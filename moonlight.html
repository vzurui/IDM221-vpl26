    <p><strong>Moonlight Exercise</strong>: For this exercise, it was a simple and short activity that focused on strategically overlapping layers and more pen tool practice. I was also able to play around with transparency within layers in this activity to create shadows and more depth. I used different shades of the same color to add on to the depths and create more of a spotlight for the main subject in this.</p>
