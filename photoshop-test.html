    <p><strong>Dramatic B&amp;W Exercise</strong>: For this exercise, the main objective was to become more familiar with layers and the tools Adobe Photoshop has to offer. I mainly learned the mask tool for this activity. I turned the entire picture black and white and picked a subject to bring color back to. In the end, it creates a bold contrast between the color and the gray colors.</p>

    <p><strong>B&amp;W Recolor Exercise</strong>: For this project, it was similar to the Dramatic B&amp;W exercise but expanded on those techniques used. The objective was to find a black &amp; white image and fully recolor it. The brush and paint tool were heavily used for this project. Precision and accuracy in color were helpful when completing this as well. While being a tedious project, it allowed me to learn many new techniques to create more of a realistic recolor.</p>
