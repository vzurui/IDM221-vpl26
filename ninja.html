    <p><strong>Ninja Exercise</strong>: For this exercise, the purpose of it was to explore a majority of Adobe Illustrator to become familiar with certain tools and the possibilities the program has. I created these ninjas using the same technique but differing it for each of them to create new poses. Similarly, I also was able to learn new techniques when it came to the weapons that the ninjas hold. I also experimented with stroke weights and adding multiple strokes to create that depth within the characters.</p>
