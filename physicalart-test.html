        <p><strong>Asymmetrical Piece</strong>: For this project, the main objective was to play around with negative and positive space and then add in another element, the space when B&amp;W were mixed. I looked at a variety of pictures and magazines to then find intricate outlines within the spaces to create new biomorphic and abstract shapes.
      With all my new shapes, I assembled them into a composition that I found interesting enough. After that, I carefully chose what I wanted to be black, white or gray. The project required a large amount of precision since all of the lines were free-handed with paint. In the end, I was able to create an asymmetrical piece that allowed me to introduce myself to mixing positive and negative spaces.</p>

        <p><strong>Symmetrical Piece</strong>: For this project, it is another version of my asymmetrical piece that included biomorphic shapes. 
          This version is symmetrical instead. I created the composition of this one to be more intricate to make the symmetry more interesting to look at. I used the different placements of black, white and gray to give some of the abstract shapes a “see-through” effect as well.</p>

        <p><strong>Paper Pattern Piece</strong>: For this small project, the main objective was to find interesting textures within the real world and transfer that into a piece. The usage of black, white and gray were repeated multiple times in this course to become familiar with the positive and negative space.</p>
        Similar to other pieces, I had to look at pictures and read in between the lines to find interesting silhouettes and shapes that I could use. I created a symmetrical composition and strategically placed where I wanted a pattern or a colored space. The project required precision with free-hand cutting to create the sharp patterns and to keep it symmetrical.</p>

        <p><strong>Metamorphosis Final Project</strong>: For this project, the objective was to take all the elements that I have seen in class and to put it all in one piece. While including all of these elements, we were supposed to create a seamless transition for it and have it turn out to be a kind of “metamorphosis”.
        Many people came up with themes so that it would be more helpful to create this metamorphosis piece. I chose the two opposing words of “rigid” and “mellow” to depict a sharper and softer side to my piece. From there, I included the elements I encountered in the courses such as the biomorphic shapes, the different grayscale, textures, etc. </p>
