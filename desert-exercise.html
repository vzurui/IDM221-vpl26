<p><strong>Desert Exercise:</strong> For this exercise, the purpose of it was to become more familiar with the gradient tool within Adobe Illustrator. I recreated a desert landscape and experimented with a color palette. Using the different gradients and colors, I was able to create a certain depth in the picture to show the full scenery. I incorporated other skills within the exercise such as precise pen tool use for the small features at the bottom and also other brushes to create the scattered look of stars.</p>
