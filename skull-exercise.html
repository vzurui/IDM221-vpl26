    <p><strong>Skull Exercise</strong>: For this exercise, it was one of my first experiences with Adobe Illustrator so the objective was to mess around with the program and become more used to all the tools it had to offer. I ended up going off of a pink and red color palette to create this skull. I used lots of different tools, techniques, strokes, etc. in this exercise that prepared me for later projects.</p>
