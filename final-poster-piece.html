    <p><strong>Final Poster Piece</strong>: For the project, my objective was to pick any social issue and to create a campaign poster for it as my final project in one of my graphic design courses. While going through this process, I was supposed to incorporate many of the elements that I learned during the class.
        In the end, I was able to come up with this campaign poster for homophobia during pride month. I used many of the same techniques I learned in class but also incorporated new techniques that I envisioned when I first came up with the piece. This piece received a large amount of positive feedback but also a fair amount of criticism that I can use to apply for future projects.</p>
