  Hi, I’m Vy! I am a student at Drexel University majoring in User Experience and Interaction Design. Through the purpose of user experience, we bridge the gap between technology and art. I strive to design experiences that connect and inspire users everywhere. Digital design is always expanding and I want to contribute to making it more accessible, more enjoyable and easier for everyone to use. Together, let’s explore the potential in UXID to create greater things!
