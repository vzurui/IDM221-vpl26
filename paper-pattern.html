        <p><strong>Paper Pattern Piece</strong>: For this small project, the main objective was to find interesting textures within the real world and transfer that into a piece. The usage of black, white and gray were repeated multiple times in this course to become familiar with the positive and negative space.</p>
        Similar to other pieces, I had to look at pictures and read in between the lines to find interesting silhouettes and shapes that I could use. I created a symmetrical composition and strategically placed where I wanted a pattern or a colored space. The project required precision with free-hand cutting to create the sharp patterns and to keep it symmetrical.</p>
