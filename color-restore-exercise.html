        <p><strong>B&amp;W Recolor Exercise</strong>: For this project, it was similar to the Dramatic B&amp;W exercise but expanded on those techniques used. The objective was to find a black &amp; white image and fully recolor it. The brush and paint tool were heavily used for this project. Precision and accuracy in color were helpful when completing this as well. While being a tedious project, it allowed me to learn many new techniques to create more of a realistic recolor.</p>
