        <p><strong>Metamorphosis Final Project</strong>: For this project, the objective was to take all the elements that I have seen in class and to put it all in one piece. While including all of these elements, we were supposed to create a seamless transition for it and have it turn out to be a kind of “metamorphosis”.
        Many people came up with themes so that it would be more helpful to create this metamorphosis piece. I chose the two opposing words of “rigid” and “mellow” to depict a sharper and softer side to my piece. From there, I included the elements I encountered in the courses such as the biomorphic shapes, the different grayscale, textures, etc. </p>
