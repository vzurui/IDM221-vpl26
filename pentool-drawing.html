    <p><strong>Pen Tool Drawing:</strong> For this exercise, the purpose of this was to practice pen tool precision and become more familiar with the power the pen tool has. My objective was to make a sketch of any real-life view using the pen tool. I chose a corner of my dorm which contained many intricate lines and folds to really challenge myself when it came to the pen tool. In the end, my precision increased and I became more used to the different usages the pen tool had and learned to use it more efficiently.</p>
